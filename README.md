scrm
====

_scrm_ is a coalescent simulator for biological sequences. Different to similar programs, 
it can approximate the coalescent with recombination as closely as needed, but still has 
only linear runtime cost for long sequences. It allows you to rapidly simulate chromosome 
scale sequences with an essentially correct genetic linkage structure.


## Installation
### Stable Release (recommended) 
You can download the latest stable release packaged for a variety of different
platform from [_scrm_'s homepage][1]. 
Instructions on building the binary from the source packages are available in the [wiki][3].

### Stable/Development Version From GitHub

Version             | Branch | Build Status
------------------- | ------ | -----------------
Stable Version      | stable | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scrm/scrm.png?branch=stable)](https://travis-ci.org/scrm/scrm)
Development Version | master | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scrm/scrm.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scrm/scrm)

You can also install `scrm` directly from the git repository. Here, you need to install `autoconf` first:  

On Debian/Ubuntu based systems:
```bash
apt-get install build-essential autoconf autoconf-archive libcppunit-dev
```

On Mac OS:
```bash
port install automake autoconf autoconf-archive cppunit 
```

Afterwards you can build the binary using 
```bash
./bootstrap
make
```


## Usage
We designed scrm to be compatible to the famous program `ms` from Richard R. Hudson. 
You can use it as a drop in replacement for `ms` if you avoid the options `-c` and `-s`. 
Details are available [in the wiki][2]. 


## Troubleshooting
If you encounter problems while using _scrm_, please 
[file a bug report](https://github.com/scrm/scrm/wiki/Reporting-Bugs) or mail to
`develop (at) paulstaab.de`.
